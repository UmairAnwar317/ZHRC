                    <p>Homeopathy is a two hundred and twenty year old system of medicine.  A German doctor Samuel Hahnemann discovered its principles in 1796, although it is based on observations going back to Hippocrates. Our page Homeopathy Explained has a full description of the history and philosophy. It is now one of the most widespread and recognised forms of alternative medicine in the world today. <br> <br>
                        While it has stood the test of time, it is currently the subject of vigorous campaigns  to discredit it in the western world. In places like India, on the other hand, it is largely recognised and integrated into the medical system. It cannot completely replace orthodox medicine. Both have their place. We see it as complementary, and that is the message we wish to convey. <br> <br>
                        In some places it is assumed to be a synonym for alternative medicine. In Australia, however, naturopathy has gained that title. This is a true umbrella term. But homeopathy is a very specific form of natural medicine, with its own principles and philosophy, prescribing principles and methods of preparation. It is the main therapy used at our Perth naturopathic clinic. <br><br>
                        While superficially it is a challenge to accepted medical science, it has a very logical, consistent philosophy and methodology. It is no more challenging than quantum physics is to Newtonian physics. Both appear to contradict each other, but both are true in their own sphere.

                    <h2>What is Health?</h2>
                    <p>Health is no more nor less than the relative absence of symptoms on all homeopathy and allopathy 8three levels of being: mental, emotional and physical. In advising on the current lifestyle blocks – obstructions to cure as Hahnemann described them – the homeopath assists the patient to heal themselves. In reflecting back to them their imbalance on all levels and providing the remedy that matches their life experiences and trauma patterns, we believe that true healing is catalysed at a dynamic level. Homeopaths see that every day in practice. <br> <br>
                        Modern medicine is wonderful at saving lives. It is necessary for emergencies and surgery. Because homeopathy works with the healing force of the patient, at times that force may be too weakened to be restored. Homeopathy can also palliate, or help manage symptoms, but in some chronic cases drug treatment may be the best option. <br><br>
                        It is important that both homeopathy and orthodox medicine work together in the best interests of the patient.
